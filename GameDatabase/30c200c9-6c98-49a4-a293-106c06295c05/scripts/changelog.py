        "You may need to reinstall image packs as the organization of the sets have changed.  All of your saved decks will still work without any changes.",
        "Don't forget to check the new Image Fetcher plugin in the Deck Editor!  Find it in the Plugins drop-down menu.  It will install any images you are missing.",
        "Most of the game actions you're familiar with have changed or been removed.  Please take some time to explore the new options.",
        "The game now emphasizes a more natural, manual gameplay style.  Automated scripting has been removed but select scripts may return in the future.",
